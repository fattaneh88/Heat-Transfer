# Heat-Transfer
Here is modified generalized Laguerre function implementations of the following publication:

K. Parand, F. Baharifard, F. Bayat Babolghani. Comparison between rational Gegenbauer and modified generalized Laguerre functions collocation methods for solving the case of heat transfer equations arising in porous medium, to International Journal of Industrial Mathematics 2012

Our implementations are built in Maple 2013.
